<h2>About crossy road game</h2>
Crossy Road is an arcade video game released on 20 November 2014. It was developed and published by Hipster Whale,
with the name and concept of the game playing on the age old joke "Why did the chicken cross the road?" 
The game has been described as "endless Frogger."
The objective of Crossy Road is to cross an endless highway or series of roads and avoid obstacles as far as possible
without dying. The player plays as a chosen character and must tap to go forward or swipe the screen in the 
appropriate direction to move the character horizontally. The game consists of an endless series of obstacles in
a set path, such as rivers, cars and trains. The player must time movements correctly in order to pass these obstacles
without dying.

<h2>About this game</h2>
<hr>
Creation of this game was a part of programming class.
Main goal was to solidify knowledge of OOP programming and turtle (GUI) package.
I've added images (graphics) instead of default object shapes (namely player character and cars.)
The screen background was modified as well, to make the game look as similar to the original as possible .

This game is in a compare to the original "Crossy road" much,much simpler, as the player can only move forward and there
are no series of roads and other obstacles other than driving cars randomly generated on screen.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Simply fork the project. You are free to modify, optimize it or add new things to it.

<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<hr>
There are several still open bugs to be fixed:
<ul>
    <li>Car objects collide with each other.</li>
    <li>Player can move only forward.</li>
</ul>

Will possibly be added in the future version:
1. No more car collisions.
2. Possible additional player movements.
3. Two-way lanes for driving cars.
4. Better graphics.
